# Spring JDBC Project
This project showcases a basic implementation of a Spring application utilizing JDBC API to interact with a MySQL database. It demonstrates how to establish a connection to the database using HikariCP connection pooling without manually managing connections.

### Features:
#### Database Connectivity: 
Connects to a MySQL database using HikariCP connection pooling.
#### Data Retrieval: 
Fetches all the data present in the connected database.
#### Dependency Injection: 
Utilizes Spring's dependency injection to manage dependencies effectively.
#### Interface Implementation: 
Demonstrates implementation of interfaces for better code organization.
#### Spring Integration: 
Integrates JDBC API seamlessly into the Spring framework.

### Why Spring JDBC?
While this project currently utilizes Spring with JDBC API directly, it serves as a stepping stone towards understanding the need for more advanced Spring modules like Spring JDBC and Spring Data JPA. These modules provide higher levels of abstraction, reduce boilerplate code, and offer enhanced functionality for database operations. By starting with a basic Spring JDBC project, you can grasp fundamental concepts before delving into more complex Spring data access mechanisms.

### Next Steps:
In the future, the project will evolve to incorporate Spring JDBC, a part of the Spring framework specifically designed for JDBC-based database access. Additionally, exploration into Spring Data JPA will be pursued to leverage its powerful features for working with relational databases in a more streamlined and efficient manner.
